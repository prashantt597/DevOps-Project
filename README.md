## 🏗️ Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps implementation for a Flask web application, featuring:

- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform
- **Container Orchestration** with Amazon EKS
- **CI/CD Pipeline** with GitHub Actions
- **Comprehensive Security** at all layers
- **Monitoring & Observability** with CloudWatch and Prometheus
- **Multi-Environment** deployments (Dev, Staging, Production)

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup
```
# Clone the repository structure
mkdir flask-devops-project && cd flask-devops-project

# Run the setup script (creates all files and structure)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Install dependencies
make install
```

### 2. Configure AWS & Terraform Backend
```
# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure

# Set up Terraform backends (run once)
chmod +x terraform/setup-backend.sh
./terraform/setup-backend.sh
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Secrets
Add these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
SONAR_TOKEN=your-sonarcloud-token
TF_STATE_BUCKET=flask-app-terraform-state-prod
TF_STATE_DYNAMODB_TABLE=terraform-state-lock-prod
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your-slack-webhook (optional)
```

### 4. Local Development
```
# Start local development environment
make deploy-local

# Run tests
make test

# Access application
open http://localhost:5000
```

### 5. Deploy to Environments
```
# Development
git checkout develop
git push origin develop  # Triggers automatic deployment

# Production
git checkout main
git push origin main     # Triggers automatic deployment
```

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Application Security
- ✅ Password strength validation (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- ✅ SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Private EKS cluster endpoints
- ✅ Security groups with minimal required access
- ✅ VPC with private subnets for workloads
- ✅ KMS encryption for secrets and logs
- ✅ IAM roles with least privilege
- ✅ Network ACLs for additional security

### Container Security
- ✅ Non-root user execution
- ✅ Minimal base images
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- ✅ Multi-stage builds
- ✅ Security contexts in Kubernetes

### Pipeline Security
- ✅ SonarCloud code quality analysis
- ✅ Trivy vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Secrets management (no hardcoded secrets)
- ✅ Image signing and verification

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks
- ✅ `/health` endpoint for application monitoring
- ✅ Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
- ✅ Load balancer health checks

### Logging
- ✅ Structured JSON logging
- ✅ CloudWatch log aggregation
- ✅ EKS cluster logging
- ✅ Application performance monitoring

### Metrics
- ✅ Prometheus metrics collection
- ✅ CloudWatch metrics
- ✅ Resource utilization monitoring
- ✅ Custom application metrics

## 🎛️ Environment Configuration

| Environment | Purpose | Resources | Database | Monitoring | Est. Cost |
|-------------|---------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Development** | Feature development and testing | Minimal (t3.small, single AZ) | SQLite | Basic | ~$50-100/month |
| **Staging** | Pre-production testing | Medium (t3.medium, multi-AZ) | RDS PostgreSQL (single) | Full | ~$200-300/month |
| **Production** | Live application | Large (m5.large, multi-AZ) | RDS PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ) | Enhanced | ~$500-800/month |

## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

### Branch Strategy
- `develop` → Automatic deployment to development & staging
- `main` → Automatic deployment to production
- Feature branches → No automatic deployment (manual testing)

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Quality**: Unit tests, SonarCloud analysis
2. **Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
3. **Build**: Docker image creation and push to ECR
4. **Infrastructure**: Terraform apply (infrastructure changes)
5. **Deploy**: Helm deployment to EKS
6. **Verify**: Health checks and smoke tests
7. **Notify**: Slack notifications

## 📈 Scaling & Performance

### Auto Scaling
- ✅ **HPA**: CPU/Memory based pod scaling (2-20 replicas)
- ✅ **Cluster Autoscaler**: Node scaling based on demand
- ✅ **Spot Instances**: Cost optimization with mixed instance types

### Performance Optimization
- ✅ **Multi-stage Docker builds**: Reduced image size
- ✅ **Resource limits**: Proper CPU/memory allocation
- ✅ **Connection pooling**: Database connection optimization
- ✅ **CDN ready**: Static assets can be served via CloudFront

## 🔧 Customization Points

### Application
- Modify `app/app.py` for new features
- Update `app/templates/` for UI changes
- Add new routes and functionality

### Infrastructure
- Adjust `terraform/environments/*/terraform.tfvars` for resource sizing
- Modify `terraform/modules/` for infrastructure changes
- Update `helm/flask-app/values-*.yaml` for Kubernetes configuration

### Pipeline
- Modify `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` for pipeline changes
- Update `sonar-project.properties` for code quality rules
- Adjust `trivy.yaml` for security scanning configuration

## 🎯 Corporate Best Practices Followed

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything defined in version control
- **GitOps**: Declarative deployments via Git workflows
- **Security First**: Multiple security layers and scanning
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack
- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances, resource right-sizing
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-AZ deployments, automated backups
- **Compliance**: Audit trails, encryption, access controls
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and runbooks

## 🚨 Production Checklist

- [ ] Domain name configured with SSL certificate
- [ ] WAF rules configured for your use case
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery tested
- [ ] Security groups restricted to necessary access
